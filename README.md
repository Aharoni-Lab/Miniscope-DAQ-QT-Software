This Miniscope DAQ software is an upgrade and replacement to our previous DAQ software. It is written completely in QT, using C++ for the backend and QT Quick (QML and Java) for the front end. This software supports all current and previous Miniscopes but requires the most up-to-date version of the Miniscope DAQ Firmware.

All information can be found on the [Miniscope DAQ Software Wiki page](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software/wiki).

Along with this repository holding the software's source code, you can get built release versions of the software on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software/releases).
