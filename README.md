# Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software
Neural and behavior control and recording software for the UCLA Miniscope Project

This Miniscope DAQ software is an upgrade and replacement to our previous DAQ software. It is written completely in QT, using C++ for the backend and QT Quick (QML and Java) for the front end. This software supports all current and previous Miniscopes but requires the most up-to-date version of the Miniscope DAQ Firmware.

All information can be found on the [Miniscope DAQ Software Wiki page](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software/wiki).
